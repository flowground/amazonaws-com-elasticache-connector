    "description": "Amazon ElastiCache Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to\nset up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.\n\nWith ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,\nin-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and\nmanaging a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster\nfailure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.\n\nIn addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced\nvisibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and\ncan receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.",
